# Homework-01

I was given a working, styled website and asked to perform the following tasks:

---
### Task #1: replace all div elements with semantic HTML tags

    I learned that semantic HTML tags are not only useful in making websites more
    accessable for visually impared users, but it did make the code easier for me to 
    read as well.  I used to use the classes to figure out what the div was for, but
    it was unclear where divs ended (I used to comment:  <!-- END Header --> so I 
    didn't get mixed up and need to track it down every time I nest a new div.)

---
### Task #2: reorder HTML elements to logical structure not by style

    These appeared to be pretty much in order... top to bottom, left to right seems pretty logical.

---
### Task #3: add alt attribute to image elements
    
    I had a choice to make here.  Adding the alt attribute to the img elements was easy,
    but I was not sure if the client wanted an alt attribute on the large image under 
    the header.  I made two copies, one where it used the stylesheet to add the image
    as a background and the second where I added and img element in the header.  
    I went with the img element because the assignment was to add alt to ALL images.  
    My client might not understand that a background is different than an img element.
    I have the other files to show them if they would like to compare the two - I don't
    like the current index.html as well, but I am not the client.

---
### Task #4: ensure h1, h2, h3 follow sequential order

    I think this was already done.

---
### Task #5: add a concise, descriptive title
    It seems like the client is showcasing their services they offer their customers
    so I think "Horiseon | Our Services" makes sense.
